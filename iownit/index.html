  			<p>
  				  In 2011, I moved to San Francisco after two years of teaching English to kindergarten and elementary school kids in Seoul, Korea. My plans were to change course and study coding and design in order to begin a career in web development. After considering my options, I discovered the only way to make this happen would require enrollment in a college degree program, which would take at least two years to complete and offer dubious results. With an unused degree in advertising under my belt, I opted to pursue a career in marketing and social media instead.
  			</p>
  			<p>This path proved to be a great experience. I became knowledgeable in the many facets of marketing for an e-commerce company, and was given the opportunity to build much of the social media presence from scratch. I loved the creative aspects of the job, including writing pun-filled Valentine's Day cards for our Facebook fans and making stop-motion videos to post on Vine.
  			</p>
  		</div>
  		<div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Despite my passion for the work, I soon realized it wasn't challenging in the way I wanted it to be. In 2014, I left my full-time position to travel around Europe and Asia for seven months while continuing to work part-time.
        </p>
        <p>Upon returning to San Francisco at the beginning of this year, I joined a free front-end development class at Noisebridge, a hackerspace in the city. This class reignited my interest in coding, and I found myself reassessing my options. I was happy to discover that the opportunities for learning coding had grown dramatically since my first attempt, and soon enough I was researching programming bootcamps.
        </p>
        <p>Once I decided to focus on Javascript as my first programming language, I knew Hack Reactor was where I wanted to be. After studying for a few months, I interviewed for the program, and the next day I was ecstatic to hear that I was accepted into their August 2015 cohort.

    	  	    Javascript appealed to me as my first programming language because it's ubiquitous and flexible, and I will be able to use it for a wide range of projects and applications.

    				  Although I was initially drawn to the front-end side of development, I am excited to learn more about back-end capabilities.

    			    Programming can be very challenging, and I appreciate the way it forces me to think.

    				  I look forward to building applications that are fun, one-of-a-kind, easy to use, and make the users' lives a little easier.

  				    There's nothing quite like the pride I feel after solving a tricky problem using beautifully concise code.

    		    While working in marketing and social media, I became familiar with Optimizely. Before the company I worked for had implemented the platform, we attempted to test the effectiveness of different copy and photos on our own but it was almost impossible to find out the results. Once the company had set up Optimizely, it quickly became apparent how useful the product is in helping its users achieve goals while also providing the best experience for their customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now as I start down a path towards a career in software engineering, it's important to me to build products that I'm passionate about for companies that I hold in high regard. Working at a company that encourages women engineers is also essential for me, and the "I Own It" program makes it clear that Optimizely falls into that category. I would be incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be granted a Hack Reactor scholarship, mentor, and internship through this program.

Although the project was solely meant to be a way to apply our knowledge of functional programming, one of my goals for the summer is to keep building it out until it's a working game.
