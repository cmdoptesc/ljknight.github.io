			<p>
				  In 2011, I moved to San Francisco after two years of teaching English to kindergarten and elementary school kids in Seoul, Korea. Back in the US, I intended to change course and study coding and design in order to begin a career in web development. After considering my options, I discovered the only way to make this happen would require enrollment in a college degree program, take at least two years to complete, and offer dubious results. With an unused degree in advertising under my belt, I opted to pursue a career in marketing and social media instead.</p>

      <p>This path proved to be a great experience. I became knowledgeable in the many facets of marketing for an e-commerce company, and was given the opportunity to build much of the social media presence from scratch. I loved the creative aspects of the job, including writing pun-filled Valentine's Day cards for our Facebook fans and making stop-motion videos to post on Vine.</p>

      <p>Despite my passion for the job, I soon realized it wasn't challenging in the way I wanted it to be. After two years, I left my full-time position to travel around Europe and Asia for seven months while continuing to work part-time.</p>

      <p>Upon returning to San Francisco at the beginning of this year, I joined a free front-end development class at <a href="https://noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a>, a hackerspace in the Mission. This class reignited my interest in coding, and I found myself reassessing my options. I was happy to discover that the opportunities for learning coding had grown dramatically since my first attempt, and soon enough I was researching programming bootcamps.</p>

      <p>Once I decided to focus on Javascript as my first programming language, I knew Hack Reactor was where I wanted to be. After studying for a few months, I interviewed for the program, and the next day I was ecstatic to hear that I got into their August 2015 cohort.</p>

			<h2 id="goals">Goals: Why I Want to Learn How to Code</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="info-section">
				<ul>
				  <li>
				    I chose to learn Javascript first because it's ubiquitous and flexible. I will be able to use it for a wide range of projects and applications.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    Although I was initially drawn to the front-end side of development, I am excited to learn more about back-end capabilities.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    It can be very challenging, and I appreciate the way it forces me to think.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    Building applications and solving problems allows me to be creative.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    It's a field that's constantly evolving and being updated, so I will continue to learn throughout my career.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    There's nothing like the feeling I get after I solve a tricky problem using beautifully concise code. And then I get to point at it and say, "I wrote that!"
